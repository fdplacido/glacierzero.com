[{"content":"Tmux has 2 main functions:\n Creating, accessing and managing terminals from a single screen Detaching and reattaching to the session: it allows you to continue were you left  Here I share the workflow I use everyday at work and my personal computer, explaining with it what I believe are the core features of tmux.\nWhy tmux tmux is a tool to organize yourself in your terminal:\n create and close windows names windows for easier organization split windows vertically and/or horizontally into panes as much as you want focus on some specific pane move around between windows and panes detach from a session and come back days later and continue everything were you left it share sessions between computers  Many of these things can be achieved with other tools, or combination of tools. Some terminals can split windows, in other you can open as many tabs or windows you want, other tools allow you to resume your work after closing a terminal.\nBut tmux is a central place to do all this, it is indepent from the application you use to access a terminal, and you can use it in remote servers to keep using your workflow. One only needs to learn the shortcuts, which work around a prefix key followed by some other key or keys: ctrl + b by default.\nWith it I can open any number of files in my text editor of choice, arranged in splits or windows however I prefer. I can be compiling some big project in one windows, then switch to other window to start a web server while the other window is compiling, then jump to a window with two files opened split vertically to compare them. And at the end of the day I can just detach, and continue were I left the day after: same arrangement, windows.\nLong running tasks like compilation or tests may be left running in background without a remote session being killed for inactivity.\nSessions Sessions allow to manage groups of windows, one can connect and disconnect from these, like changing projects or workspaces. I almost never use more than one session: I just connect and work with the same session.\n# Create new named session tmux new -s \u0026lt;session name\u0026gt; # attach to named session tmux a -t \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; tmux attach -t \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; # detach from session prefix + d # attach to last used session tmux a Whenever I start a terminal I automatically connect to it through my .bashrc file with the following:\n####################################################### # Load tmux on first terminal ####################################################### # 1. check existance of tmux command # 2. check for interactive shell (PS1) # 3.
