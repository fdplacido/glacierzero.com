      <description>Some will disagree since this differs between countries, regions or even companies. But this should be a common ground that everyone can understand what one is referring to. Probably brackets are the most controversial.
This are the most common names to refer to various symbols often found when programming:
() : brackets / parenthesis [] : square brackets {} : curly brackets &amp;lt;&amp;gt; : angle brackets &amp;#34; : double quote &amp;#39; : single quote ` : backquote # : hash - : dash _ : underscore : : colon ; : semicolon .</description>

      <description>Tmux has 2 main functions:
 Creating, accessing and managing terminals from a single screen Detaching and reattaching to the session: it allows you to continue were you left  Here I share the workflow I use everyday at work and my personal computer, explaining with it what I believe are the core features of tmux.
Why tmux tmux is a tool to organize yourself in your terminal:
 create and close windows names windows for easier organization split windows vertically and/or horizontally into panes as much as you want focus on some specific pane move around between windows and panes detach from a session and come back days later and continue everything were you left it share sessions between computers  Many of these things can be achieved with other tools, or combination of tools.</description>
