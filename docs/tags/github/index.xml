      <description>If you often browse Github repositories on your browser, chances are you find yourself moving between files, jumping between lines, reviewing diffs and other common source code related tasks. Github has a list of commands[1] and keyboard shortcuts[2] to move around faster.
Here are the keyboard shortcuts that I find myself using more often to navigate and interact with Github repositories:
 Ctrl + k: Open command palette with fuzzy search  From here you make a wide range of actions by just writting: where you want to, or what you want to do Search is fuzzy, so you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to type the complete command, or even correctly Navigate between tabs, just type: issues, PRs, Actions, Settings Navigate between repositories: delete the repository name, and start writing a different one which belogs to the user or organization Run commands by typing &amp;gt;.</description>
