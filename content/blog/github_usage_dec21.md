If you often browse Github repositories on your browser, chances are you find yourself moving between files, jumping between lines, reviewing *diffs* and other common source code related tasks. Github has a list of commands[[1]](#r1-github-commands) and keyboard shortcuts[[2]](#r2-github-shortcuts) to move around faster.

Here are the keyboard shortcuts that I find myself using more often to navigate and interact with Github repositories:

- `Ctrl + k`: Open **command palette** with fuzzy search
  + From here you make a wide range of actions by just writting: where you want to, or what you want to do
  + Search is fuzzy, so you don't even need to type the complete command, or even correctly
  + Navigate between tabs, just type: issues, PRs, Actions, Settings
  + Navigate between repositories: delete the repository name, and start writing a different one which belogs to the user or organization
  + Run commands by typing `>`. From here one can run things like: creating an issue, close a pull request or updating the current branch
- `t`: File finder
  + When you know the name of the file you are looking for, or part of it, just start typing it to filter the possible results
  + Easy to filter by extension or some other pattern in the file name: type part of the name, then `.` followed by the extension to filter further
- `l`: Go to line
  + With a file opened, jump directly to some line by typing the number
- `w`: Switch to a branch or tag
  + To quickly change to some branch or tag if you know the name or part of the name of it
- `e`: Edit file
  + I don't find myself using this one much, but some quick or small changes it may be useful when you are not working with your local editor
- `.`: Open in web editor
  + If not working in your own machine, only have access to a browser, or don't have access to your everyday source code editor or IDE, this option gives you an online IDE. It is an online instance of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with all of its features, one of the outcomes of Microsoft buying Github.
