Some will disagree since this differs between countries, regions or even companies. But this should be a common ground that everyone can understand what one is referring to. Probably brackets are the most controversial.

This are the most common names to refer to various symbols often found when programming:

```
()  : brackets / parenthesis
[]  : square brackets
{}  : curly brackets
<>  : angle brackets
"   : double quote
'   : single quote
`   : backquote
#   : hash
-   : dash
_   : underscore
:   : colon
;   : semicolon
.   : period
@   : at
&   : ampersand
/   : slash
\   : backslash
|   : pipe
~   : tilde
^   : caret
*   : asterisk
```
