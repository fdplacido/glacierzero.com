Hi there! I am Plácido. Welcome to my personal site.


I am a Computing Engineer doing science at [CERN](https://home.cern/). I work on design, architecture and development of software for future detectors for High Energy Physics.


I did my PhD in Computer Science and Technology at CERN, in the [LHCb](https://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/) experiment, with University Carlos III of Madrid.

> My PhD thesis: [Particle Tracking and Identification on multi- and many-core hardware platforms](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2752883)
