Hi there! I am PlÃ¡cido. Welcome to my personal site.

I am a Computing Engineer doing computing science at [CERN](https://home.cern/). I currently work on design, architecture and development of software for future detectors for High Energy Physics.

I did my PhD in Computer Science and Technology at CERN, in the [LHCb](https://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/) experiment, with University Carlos III of Madrid.

Prior to my experience in Computing for High Energy Physics I worked in the space industry, at [GMV](https://www.gmv.com/en), developing software for satellite control centers. Before that I did an intership at [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en) in the rail signaling area.
