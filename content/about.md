Hi there! I am PlÃ¡cido. Welcome to my personal site.


I am a Computing Engineer doing science at [CERN](https://home.cern/). I work on design, architecture and development of software for future detector for High Energy Physics.


I did my PhD in Computer Science and Technology at CERN, in the [LHCb](https://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/) experiment, with University Carlos III of Madrid.
